NextGen Sparx – Responsive Landing Page Project Overview

This repository contains the source code for the NextGen Sparx responsive landing page — developed as part of an internship project.

The objective was to design and implement a modern, responsive web page using only HTML and CSS, focused on connecting students with real-world internship opportunities.

Platform Focus

NextGen Sparx bridges the gap between students and structured, hands-on internship experiences.

Goal: To capture user interest (students and mentors) and drive engagement through a clear Call-to-Action (CTA).

Key Features

Responsive Design: Adapts seamlessly to desktop, tablet, and mobile devices using CSS Flexbox and media queries.

Dynamic Logo Animation: A spinning logo element (.logo img) symbolizes innovation and energy.

Two-Line Logo Text: The brand name appears as NextGen / SparX for distinct visual identity.

Clear Visual Hierarchy: Structured with a focused header, an impactful Hero section, and a clean footer.

Modern Styling: Uses Google Fonts (Poppins) and a blue accent color #007bff for a professional, minimal look.

Learning & Internship Takeaways

During this project, I focused on:

Mastering Flexbox: Built two-column Hero and multi-column Footer layouts efficiently.

Responsive Workflow: Followed a mobile-first approach, enhancing for larger screens via media queries (@media (max-width: 900px)).

CSS Best Practices: Maintained a clean and modular stylesheet, emphasizing reusability and clarity
